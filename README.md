## üéÆ Game Overview

**Blade Bound** is an action-adventure 3D game developed in Unity where players wield powerful blades to battle through multiple levels filled with enemies and challenging boss encounters. This game was created as a group project for a University Game Development course and represents our team's first collaborative game development experience.

> **Developer Note:** This game is not perfect and contains various bugs and architectural issues. However, our team learned a tremendous amount through the development process. It represents our very first group game project, and we're proud of what we accomplished despite the imperfections.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Unity 2021.3 or later (the version used for development)
- Basic understanding of Unity interface

### Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the project
2. Open the project in Unity
3. Open the main menu scene in Assets/Scenes/MENU
4. Press Play to start the game

## üß™ Development Process

This game was developed as a team project for a University Game Development course. Our development process included:

1. Initial concept and design phase
2. Core mechanics implementation
3. Level design and enemy placement
4. Boss battle mechanics development
5. Visual effects and polish
6. Testing and refinement

### Learning Experience

As our first collaborative game project, Blade Bound provided extremely valuable lessons in:

- Team collaboration and communication in game development
- Code architecture and organization challenges
- Real-time problem-solving and debugging
- Game performance optimization
- Technical debt management
- The importance of documentation and version control

While the game has its flaws in terms of bugs and architecture design, each challenge helped us grow as developers. We gained practical experience that theoretical learning alone couldn't provide, making this project an essential stepping stone in our development journey.
